# MSSSStaffFileSystem

MSSSStaffFileSystem is a small C# project I built to practice working with files and basic data management.  
It lets me store and manage staff details in a simple way, using a console interface.

## Features

- Add new staff records
- View existing staff records
- Update or remove staff entries
- Save and load data from files so it persists between runs

## Tech stack

- C#
- .NET (console application)
- Basic file I/O for storing staff information

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XanderSmithh/MSSSStaffFileSystem.git
   cd MSSSStaffFileSystem
